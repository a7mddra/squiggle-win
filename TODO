# TODO

**task 1:**
    we need to improve error handling for the upload methods.
    method 1: via welcome tab, if img isnt jpg, jpeg, png, or wepb showFeedbackMessage "unsuported format" or if it bigger than 20MiB same behaviour. also dont leave welcome page so user should try uploading again.
    method 2: via CLI, if the path/to/img isnt exist or not PNG (only) or bigger than 20MiB you should instantly exit(1).

**task 2:**
    make the nav-left buttons work. i want if aimode pressed to be in active mode (icon + hover) and same for the golens butn also for the content make both empty screens for now but ready to code like create for each screen its index.js in the correct place in /tabs/ with a centered text "this is $xx tab" so i can nav between them with the 2 buttons.

**task 3:**
    format gemini block in config.private.json to be organized like oauth then explain it in config.example.json with the same way i used for oauth since these data is gitignored.

**task 4:**
    let's build the aimode tab. i want to detach the image viewer screen and start the app with aimode tab selected. in aimode we will send the image (that img was in image viewer before) via api to ai to review. we will send it with the prompt saved in the settings tab. correct the logic of 'customize prompt' option to be synced with aimode tab then we will send this prompt attached with the image then print the api response.
    for the styling we need to follow the satandard broser LLMs theme (chat-like) with animations (token by token printing) and modern scene (formal&quite not hyped).
    for the flow: think of it a gemini/gpt chat but first msg is automated img+saved prompt and ai responsed. the user has a prompt box to chat with the api this prompt is so simple just text no media or audio. for the engineering we need to send the chat history (texts only) to the api with every new prompt, i dont know how real LLMs work but make it the same way they work without reaching charchters limit or whatever. in the same tab create `model` option if pressed it should lit apis avaialble. we will fill it with free gemini flash api for now as a starter, but complete it's logic like if user chose another model during any part of the chat it should start a new chat with the same flow first msg is ready with the saved prompt.
    do not forget error handlings like api server busy or quota reached or any other ai failurs..
